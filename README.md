# Google homepage clone

## The goal

Welcome to the readme, which aims to reproduce identically the interface of the world-famous google page. This challenge made with HTML5 and CSS3 is ambitious for a fabulous result !!
For this, you will need to use Virtual Studio Code which can be downloaded from the internet.

```bash
https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
```

## Demo

To better see the interface, you have to go to the files provided with the readme.

## Why HTML5 et CSS3?

HTML is used to structure the page. It tells crawlers how they should understand the page and what elements it contains. The CSS contains the stylesheet for the page. The indications it gives relate exclusively to the design and appearance of the elements of the page.

## Use

If you want to resume or modify the job, you will find the following files with the lines of code:

```bash
- <!DOCTYPE htmml>.html
- style.css
```
